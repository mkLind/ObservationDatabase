OBSERVATION DATABASE

Building:

Clone repository from github. Open the folder then in Android studio. By pressing the "Run app" button, the project is built. While developing, a physical android device with android 8.0.0 was used to test the application. Minimum api level for project is 19 and max is 28. In addition to testing with physical device, the appllication was tested with emulators running android with KitKat (19) and Pie (28). 

Tests:

There are tests related to ObservationRepository.kt. They are instrumented tests, so either a physical device or emulator is needed. The tests are located in app/java/com.example.observationdatabase/ObservationRepositoryTest file.
They can be run by rightclicking on ObservationRepositoryTest file and then selecting Run from the menu that opens.
